In some cases you may need to modify your configuration file to accommodate minor deviations from your production environment. For instance, imagine your `nhost.toml` file looks like:

```
[global]
[[global.environment]]
name = 'ENVIRONMENT'
value = 'production'

... (omitted for brevity)

[hasura]
version = 'v2.24.1-ce'

... (omitted for brevity)

[hasura.logs]
level = 'warn'

... (omitted for brevity)

[auth.redirections]
clientUrl = 'https://my.app.com'

... (omitted for brevity)

[auth.method.oauth]
[auth.method.oauth.apple]
enabled = true
clientId = '{{ secrets.APPLE_CLIENT_ID }}'
keyId = '{{ secrets.APPLE_KEY_ID }}'
teamId = '{{ secrets.APPLE_TEAM_ID }}'
privateKey = '{{ secrets.APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY }}'

... (omitted for brevity)

```

While this may work in production you may want to do minor tweaks in your local development. To do so we rely on [JSON patches RFC6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902). To make use of it just drop a file under `nhost/overlays/local.yaml`. For instance, a file with the following contents would apply minor modifications to your local environment without affecting production:

```
- op: replace
  path: /hasura/version               # override hasura version
  value: "v2.25.1-ce"

- op: replace
  path: /global/environment/0         # replace first environment variables
  value:
    name: ENVIRONMENT
    value: development

- op: add                             # add a new env var
  path: /global/environment/-
  value:
    name: FUNCTION_LOG_LEVEL
    value: debug

- op: replace                         # change the client url to local
  path: /auth/redirections/clientUrl
  value: http://localhost:3000

- op: remove                          # remove apple authentication
  path: /auth/method/oauth/apple
```

To verify the that the file is being manipulated as we desire we can use the `nhost` cli:

```
$ nhost config show
[global]
[[global.environment]]
name = 'ENVIRONMENT'
value = 'development'

[[global.environment]]
name = 'FUNCTION_LOG_LEVEL'
value = 'debug'

... (omitted for brevity)

[hasura]
version = 'v2.25.1-ce'

... (omitted for brevity)

[auth.redirections]
clientUrl = 'http://localhost:3000'

... (omitted for brevity)

[auth.method.oauth]
[auth.method.oauth.apple]
enabled = false

... (omitted for brevity)

```

Once you have finished making changes, don't forget to restart your development environment by running the command `nhost up` after modifying your configuration.

:::info
While it may be convenient to modify your local environment for development, the further it deviates from production, the harder it is to detect issues before release. Therefore, we recommend keeping changes strictly necessary
