In some cases you may need to modify your configuration file to accommodate minor deviations from your production environment. For instance, imagine your `nhost.toml` file looks like:

```
[global]
[[global.environment]]
name = 'ENVIRONMENT'
value = 'production'

...

[hasura]
version = 'v2.24.1-ce'

...

[hasura.logs]
level = 'warn'

...

[auth.redirections]
clientUrl = 'https://my.app.com'

...

[auth.method.oauth]
[auth.method.oauth.apple]
enabled = true
clientId = '{{ secrets.APPLE_CLIENT_ID }}'
keyId = '{{ secrets.APPLE_KEY_ID }}'
teamId = '{{ secrets.APPLE_TEAM_ID }}'
privateKey = '{{ secrets.APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY }}'

...

```

While this may work in production you may want to do minor tweaks in your local development. To do so we rely on [JSON patches RFC6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902). To make use of it just drop a file under `nhost/overlays/local.yaml`. For instance, a file with the following contents would apply minor modifications to your local environment without affecting production:

```
- op: replace
  path: /hasura/version               # override hasura version
  value: "v2.25.1-ce"

- op: replace
  path: /global/environment/0         # replace first environment variables
  value:
    name: ENVIRONMENT
    value: development

- op: add                             # add a new env var
  path: /global/environment/-
  value:
    name: FUNCTION_LOG_LEVEL
    value: debug

- op: replace                         # change the client url to local
  path: /auth/redirections/clientUrl
  value: http://localhost:3000

- op: remove                          # remove apple authentication
  path: /auth/method/oauth/apple
```

To verify the that the file is being manipulated as we desire we can use the `nhost` cli:

```
$ nhost config show
[global]
[[global.environment]]
name = 'ENVIRONMENT'
value = 'development'

[[global.environment]]
name = 'FUNCTION_LOG_LEVEL'
value = 'debug'

...

[hasura]
version = 'v2.25.1-ce'

...

[auth.redirections]
clientUrl = 'http://localhost:3000'

...

[auth.method.oauth]
[auth.method.oauth.apple]
enabled = false

...

```
