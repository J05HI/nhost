The following guide shows how to deploy a Nhost Project from a GitHub repository, and enable automatic deployments on every push to the **Deployment Branch**.

Currently, only GitHub is supported, but other Git providers like GitLab and BitBucket are on the pipeline.

## GitHub

To setup your GitHub repository on Nhost, open the dashboard for the project you want to connect and click on "Connect to GitHub".

You might need to install the **Nhost** GitHub App in case you haven't or if the repository you want to connect to is not on the list.

Choose the account where you want to install the Nhost app and what repositories should it have access to.

Once the instalation is finished, go back to the list of repositories and click **Connect** on the repository you want to connect.

Finally, choose the deployment branch and base directory.

- Nhost only deploys changes to the **Deployment Branch**. The default branch is `main`.

- If your Nhost project is not located at the root of your Git repository, which is typically the case when using a monorepo, it's possible to set a custom **Base Directory**. The **Base Directory** is where the `nhost/` directory is located. In other words, the **Base Directory** is the parent directory of the `nhost/` directory.

It's possible to have multiple Nhost projects connected to the same Git repository and use different **Deployment Branches** (e.g., `main` and `staging`). Learn more about [multiple environments](/platform/multiple-environments).

The Deployment Branch and Base Directory can be updated on the project's settings page -> Deployments.
